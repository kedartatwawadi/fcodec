Here, I plan to write details about what all tests were conducted etc. 

## Setup
1. Install Matlab: 
2. Install ffmpeg: (custom ffmpeg install.sh script)
3. Install opencv:

    - Follow: [Opencv Install link](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-last-rst/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)
    - Its much easier to use cmake-gui instead of using cmake from terminal (at least for me). Verify if python, matlab, and ffmpeg flags are set ON.

## Datasets
Currently using Ford Datasets. But need to check KITTI, and other datasets provided.

## Experiments:
#### Quality
Quality testing with different CRF levels for different codecs like: VP9,x264,x265. 

#### Low-Level Algorithms
Optical Flow etc. (What else?)

#### High Level Algorithms
